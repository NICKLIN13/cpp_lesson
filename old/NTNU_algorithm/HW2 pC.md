You might want to take a look at non-programming homework if you have no idea.

# non-programming homework
Can I refer to resources from the Internet or other sources that are not from textbooks
or lecture slides?
• Yes, but you must include a reference source, such as a website or book title and
page number, and attach it as a comment at the top of the code.
• Although you can refer to external resources, please write your own code after
the reference.
• Remember to specify the references; otherwise we’ll view it as cheating
