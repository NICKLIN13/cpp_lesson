1. Could you share if you had any experiences about peripheral integration with any hardware platform?  





The hardware platforms I am familiar with include Raspberry Pi and Arduino. I have used them for the following projects:

- Project 1: "Establishment of an Intelligent Mass Production System for Natural Enemies of Pests and Its Industrial Application"《建立天敵昆蟲智慧量產系統及其產業應用》

    - Designed precision feeding machine system for larvae, saving 80% of larvae feed and 30% of total production cost.

    - Programmed automated scheduler for pressure testing of a five-axis robotic arm in the rearing box storage system, improving accuracy and efficiency.

    - Developed GUI control panel and designed motion path for the robotic arm.

- Project 2: "Establishment of a Fruit Fly-Free Production Site through Automated Monitoring"《利用自動化監測建立果實蠅非疫生產點》

    - Deployed pest detection IoT system in greenhouses to ensure compliance with export regulations.

    - Integrated sensors, cameras, and embedded systems (Raspberry Pi) in the system.

    - Collected 100,000+ sensor data and 2,500+ image data, achieving a 99.8% return rate.

- Project 3: "Development of a Beehive Alert System Based on Analyzing Audio Signals"《蜂群音頻預警系統開發》

    - Deployed IoT system using edge computing and machine learning to analyze audio signals and determine beehive safety.

- Project 4: Designed a remote-controlled car that moves objects with specified features to a designated location in an obstacle-filled area.

    - Designed hardware components, including Raspberry Pi, Arduino, actuators (L298N Motor Driver, wheels, servo motors, gripper), and sensors (ultrasonic distance sensor, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor).

These experiences demonstrate my proficiency in integrating peripheral devices with hardware platforms, utilizing various sensors, actuators, cameras, and embedded systems for different applications.



1. Could you please share your experience in using python or similar language to develop a test script or validate a design?

- Situation: As a research assistant at National Taiwan University, I was tasked with developing a test script to validate the design of an intelligent mass production system for natural enemies of pests.

- Task: The task was to create a test script using Python to automate the validation process and ensure the proper functioning of a box storage system with a robotic arm..

- Action: I used Python and the custom language of the driver of the robotic arm  to develop a comprehensive test script that simulated various scenarios and inputs to validate the system's performance. The script included test cases for different aspects, such as robotic arm movements, precision feeding systems, and data analysis.

- Results: The test script I developed proved to be instrumental in validating the design of the intelligent mass production system. It helped identify and rectify potential issues, ensuring the system's efficiency and accuracy. The automated validation process saved significant time and resources compared to manual testing, resulting in a more streamlined and reliable production system.



3. Could you share an example of leading others to resolve a complex problem?



針對這個問題，用以下的素材回答。

這是我之前擔任顧問的經驗：



RPA Consultant & Software Engineer (Full-time)

Anselm Inc., Taiwan | October 2021 - May 2022



這是 RPA 的解釋：

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology that uses software robots to automate repetitive and rules-based internal business processes, enabling companies to improve efficiency and productivity.



在我擔任顧問的期間，我與我的同事共同經手此專案: Automated the production of payroll registers and bonus comparison reports for a Taiwanese automotive brand, improving accuracy by eliminating human errors and saving 75% of the time.



我們做的工作包含：

Conducted interviews and process mapping with clients, assisting companies in achieving digital transformation, freeing up valuable time for team members to focus on more strategic tasks.



了解客戶在生產 payroll 報表的業務邏輯。我們的使用者的任務是負責產出報表，但他本來不是負責這個業務，自從接手這個業務之後也只是照著前人傳下來的格式來製作新的報表，但當我和我的同事在梳理這份報表該如何自動化時，我們發現使用者也不全然了解報表中每個欄位的背後邏輯。因此在執行這份自動化腳本的專案的同時，我和我的同事也協助使用者全盤的瞭解這個報表。



During my role as an RPA Consultant and Software Engineer at Anselm Inc., I had the opportunity to lead a project aimed at automating the production of payroll registers and bonus comparison reports for a Taiwanese automotive brand. The goal was to improve accuracy by eliminating human errors and save time.

To resolve this complex problem, I took the following actions:

1. Conducted interviews and process mapping: I collaborated with clients to gain a deep understanding of their business logic and the specific requirements for producing the payroll reports. Through detailed discussions and interviews, we identified pain points and areas where automation could bring significant benefits.

2. Assisted with digital transformation: As part of the project, my team and I worked closely with the client's team members to guide them through the digital transformation process. We provided training and support to help them transition from manual report generation to utilizing the automated solution. This involved explaining the underlying logic of each field in the report and ensuring that the users fully understood the new automated process.

3. Developed and implemented the automation solution: Leveraging RPA technology, we designed and developed a customized software robot to handle the generation of payroll registers and bonus comparison reports. This involved configuring the robot to extract data from various sources, perform calculations, and generate accurate and error-free reports. We tested the solution extensively to ensure its reliability and efficiency.

The results of our efforts were impressive. By successfully automating the process, we eliminated the need for manual data entry and reduced the time required to produce the reports by 75%. This not only improved accuracy but also allowed the client's team members to focus on more strategic tasks, contributing to overall productivity and efficiency gains.

Throughout this project, I demonstrated leadership by guiding the team, coordinating with clients, and ensuring successful problem resolution. By leading others through the complexities of the project and delivering a robust automation solution, we achieved tangible results and helped the client optimize their payroll processes.
